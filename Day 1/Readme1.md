# 1️⃣Aritificial Intelligence

- It is the branch of computer science that is concerned with building smart and intelligent machines.
- example of intelligent machines are:

  - self driving cars
  - speech recognition
  - image recognition
  - voice assistant
  - chatbots

- example of non intelligent machines are:
  - typewriter
  - phone
  - calculator

# 2️⃣ Machine Learning

- Machine Learning is a tehnique to implement AI that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
- Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence.

# 3️⃣ Deep Learning

- Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning.
- Deep Learning uses artificial neural networks to process data.

# 4️⃣ Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

# 5️⃣ Supervised Learning

- In Supervised Learning, the algorithm is trained With labeled data, which means the algorithm knows the correct output for each input.

- # Types of Supervised Learning
  - Regression
  - Classification

# 6️⃣ Unsupervised Learning

- In Unsupervised Learning, the algorithm is trained With unlabeled data, which means the algorithm does not know the correct output for each input.
- # Types of Unsupervised Learning
  - Clustering
  - Dimensionality Reduction

# 7️⃣ Reinforcement Learning

- Reinforcement Learning is a machine learning technique that allows an agent to learn and make decisions based on its environment.
- The agent takes actions in the environment and receives rewards or punishments based on its actions.
- Main Goal of Reinforcement Learning is to maximize the reward.
